# MemGPT Cortex

## Overview

MemGPT Cortex acts as the intelligent core of the MemGPT ecosystem, enhancing the continuity and robustness of connections between the MemGPT agent and its clients. Inspired by the complex functionalities of the human cortex, MemGPT Cortex is designed to integrate and process information, automate interactions without direct prompts, and manage data across various platforms. It serves as a central hub that not only ensures reliable data transfer and communication but also extends the capabilities of MemGPT through scheduling, routing, and integration with other models for specialized tasks.

## Features

- **Robust Connection Management:** Ensures continuous, reliable connections between the MemGPT agent and mobile clients, employing websockets for real-time interaction and automatic reconnection mechanisms.

- **Data Buffering and Storage:** Implements a buffer system to manage data transfer, ensuring no information is lost during downtime, and utilizes a database for persistent storage of critical data.

- **Dynamic Routing:** Determines the user's current active platform (mobile, PC, Discord, etc.) and routes the agent's responses accordingly, optimizing accessibility and user experience.

- **System Prompting and Automation:** Facilitates promptless interaction with the agent, enabling it to initiate actions and respond to scheduled tasks or predefined triggers.

- **Model Integration:** Supports the integration of additional models (vision, speech, specialized tasks) into the MemGPT ecosystem, expanding the agent's capabilities beyond text-based interactions.
